- code is not documented
- everything is written in main method, it would be better to have class representing program that is run from main method
- main throws FileNotFoundException, it should handle it and inform user in a friendly way
- main method is too long
- either not initialize line variable on line 8 or don't assign it on line 17
- instead of while loop, do-while can be used which elimite need for initial line read (lines 14-18)
- dir.listFiles() on line 39 can return null which will produce NullPointerException on next line
- files listed at the end are all files in directory, not just created files, which can be missleading to user
- output file is created even if no input provided
- scanner is not closed
